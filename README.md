Hii!! I'm VinÃ­cius, but everyone knows me by Vica ðŸ˜…

I love games, especially the way they are made, and the way their creators express their feelings just like art. I love the idea of being able to express art through computers, but beyond that, I want to be able to help or create open source tools that enable other people to do the same. I have also recently discovered a love for sharing my knowledge with others.

I have experience in Web development, both Front-end and Back-end, and game development ðŸŽ®. Outside of the programming area, I enjoy taking pictures or create my own ideas through 3D modeling.

I am currently a Computer Science student at UFMS and also working at UFMS as a federal public servant.
